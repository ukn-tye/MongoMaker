# MongoMaker
This is my module 18 assignment. In this challenge I was tasked with creating an api using mongo db that allowed you to create users with friends and allow the user to have a thought and post it and allow friends to react to those thoughts. This assignment was fun and was A good challenge for me because it kind of simulated a social media app. I had a bit of trouble at the beginning of this  challenge but I created two different repos and tried it out two different ways and was able finnaly accomplish the mission. In th this assignment I used tools like ``Express" and ``Mongoose`` to complete the task.

## How to use 
* first clone this repository and then do a git install to install all needed packages.
* next type ``node index.js`` to start the server
* then use insomnia to use and test the routes
